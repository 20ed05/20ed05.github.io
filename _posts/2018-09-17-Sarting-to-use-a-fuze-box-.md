    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had our fuze box and instruction manual (bible) and wanted to start coding</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have completed a few steps and be comfortable with a fuze box</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes because Nathan and I completed a few stages and got a rough idea of how the next weeks are going to plan out and hw we are going to code/work efficiently.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt well by Nathan telling and reading through the instructions. He then summarised it to me and i put it on to the software. We looked over what we had done and then moved on to our next stage. Following this routine we got through alot and had a good understanding of the code we were putting into place. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to get into the habit of making sure my code is very specific so it carries out its purpose. Even though it did not occur much last lesson, it will definitely improve my future learning and coding!</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will come straight in and get straight on to my fuzebox work. This will mean we can work through the booklet more quickly and therefore move on to the robot arm sooner!</td>
