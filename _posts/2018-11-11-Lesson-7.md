  <tr>
    <td>With the robot arm we just got through the code quickly and then we got to play around with it. For my Github, I just used a lot of trial and error which wasn't very effective but it ended up working.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was very limited when I got frustrated. I really couldnâ€™t get what was wrong with my blog. Next time, I should probably not get myself into that position in the first place.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will move on in the lesson to the next stage and keep an eye on my Github.</td>
